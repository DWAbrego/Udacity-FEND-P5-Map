 Daniel Abrego
 Udacity FEND P5 Map Application

 README

===================================================================

This application will be a single page application of a Houston
neighborhood close to where I live. The application will have:
- a google map
- a hard coded list of google map markers that bounce 3 times when clicked
- a search bar that filters the locations as you type into an input text box
- clickable google map markers on the google map itself

When a google map marker is clicked, either from the list or from the marker
itself, an infowindow will popup over the marker.  The infowindow will pull
data from the Foursquare api and it will display 'likes', 'here now', and
a banner image if one exists.

There is a 'toggle list' button to hide the list of locations if a smaller
screen is being utilized.

===================================================================
Operating Instructions
===================================================================
To start the application, simply start index.html in a browser.

Once the application starts, the screen is filled with a map and a
couple of map markers.  You can click on a marker to see a popup window
with a bit of information provided by Foursquare such as 'likes' or
'here now.'

At the top left of the application is a window with a search box
and a list of locations corresponding to the markers on the map.  You
can type a search string into the search box, and this will in turn filter
the list.  You can also click on the items in the list, and this has
the same effect as if you had clicked on the corresponding marker.

Also next to the search box is a button labeled 'toggle list.'  This is
useful if viewing the application on in a mobile device with a limited
screen.  This will show and hide the list to make more viewing area
available.

===================================================================
Files:
===================================================================
This application will consider the list as one viewmodel, and
the map will be another viewmodel.

index.html
	This is the only html file in the application.

css/style.css
	Custom css styles are contained in this file.

js/app.js:
	This file contains the script that initializes the 2
	viewmodels.

js/mapVm.js :
	This file will encapsulate the workings of google maps API
	into a single class.  It will include the methods necessary
	to grab data from the Foursquare API.  This will also have
	a knockout binding for an error message when the map API
	cannot be loaded.

js/model.js
	This file will hold the data for the locations.  It will
	provide methods to manipulate this data as needed.

js/viewmodel.js
	This file will use knockout bindings to operate the list and
	filter text box.
