 Udacity FEND P5 Map Application

 README

===================================================================

This application will be a single page application of a Houston neighborhood 
close to where I live.  The application will have:
- a google map
- a hard coded list of google map markers that bounce 3 times when clicked
- a search bar that filters the locations as you type into an input text box
- clickable google map markers on the google map itself

When a google map marker is clicked, either from the list or from the marker itself,
an infowindow will popup over the marker.  The infowindow will pull data from 
the Foursquare api and it will display 'likes', 'here now', and a banner image 
if one exists.  

There is a 'toggle list' button to hide the list of locations if a smaller screen is being
utilized.  

===================================================================
### Files:
===================================================================
This application will consider the list as one viewmodel, and the map
will be another viewmodel.  

index.html
	This is the only html file in the application.  

css/style.css
	Custom css styles are contained in this file.  

js/app.js: 
	This file contains the script that initializes the 2 viewmodels.  

js/mapVm.js :  
	This file will encapsulate the workings of google maps API into a single class.  
	It will include the methods necessary to grab data from the Foursquare API.  
	This will also have a knockout binding for an error message when the map API
	cannot be loaded.  

js/model.js  
	This file will hold the data for the locations.  It will provide methods to
	manipulate this data as needed.  

js/viewmodel.js
	This file will use knockout bindings to operate the list and 
	filter text box.
